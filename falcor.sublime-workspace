If you need some specific macros defined\nbefore including these headers (like `WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` or\n`WINVER` for Windows, `VK_USE_PLATFORM_WIN32_KHR` for Vulkan), you must define\nthem before every `#include` of this library.\n\nYou may need to configure the way you import Vulkan functions.\n\n- By default, VMA assumes you you link statically with Vulkan API. If this is not the case,\n  `#define VMA_STATIC_VULKAN_FUNCTIONS 0` before `#include` of the VMA implementation and use another way.\n- You can `#define VMA_DYNAMIC_VULKAN_FUNCTIONS 1` and pass only pointers to `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` and\n  `vkGetDeviceProcAddr` functions through VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pVulkanFunctions.\n  All the remaining Vulkan functions will be fetched automatically.\n- Finally, you can provide your own pointers to all Vulkan functions needed by VMA using structure member\n  VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pVulkanFunctions, if you fetched them in some custom way e.g. using some loader like [Volk](https://github.com/zeux/volk).\n\n\n\\section quick_start_initialization Initialization\n\nAt program startup:\n\n-# Initialize Vulkan to have `VkPhysicalDevice`, `VkDevice` and `VkInstance` object.\n-# Fill VmaAllocatorCreateInfo structure and create #VmaAllocator object by\n   calling vmaCreateAllocator().\n\n\\code\nVmaAllocatorCreateInfo allocatorInfo = {};\nallocatorInfo.vulkanApiVersion = VK_API_VERSION_1_2;\nallocatorInfo.physicalDevice = physicalDevice;\nallocatorInfo.device = device;\nallocatorInfo.instance = instance;\n\nVmaAllocator allocator;\nvmaCreateAllocator(&allocatorInfo, &allocator);\n\\endcode\n\nOnly members `physicalDevice`, `device`, `instance` are required.\nHowever, you should inform the library which Vulkan version do you use by setting\nVmaAllocatorCreateInfo::vulkanApiVersion and which extensions did you enable\nby setting VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::flags (like #VMA_ALLOCATOR_CREATE_BUFFER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BIT for VK_KHR_buffer_device_address).\nOtherwise, VMA would use only features of Vulkan 1.0 core with no extensions.\n\n\n\\section quick_start_resource_allocation Resource allocation\n\nWhen you want to create a buffer or image:\n\n-# Fill `VkBufferCreateInfo` / `VkImageCreateInfo` structure.\n-# Fill VmaAllocationCreateInfo structure.\n-# Call vmaCreateBuffer() / vmaCreateImage() to get `VkBuffer`/`VkImage` with memory\n   already allocated and bound to it.\n\n\\code\nVkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };\nbufferInfo.size = 65536;\nbufferInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;\n\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo allocInfo = {};\nallocInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;\n\nVkBuffer buffer;\nVmaAllocation allocation;\nvmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);\n\\endcode\n\nDon't forget to destroy your objects when no longer needed:\n\n\\code\nvmaDestroyBuffer(allocator, buffer, allocation);\nvmaDestroyAllocator(allocator);\n\\endcode\n\n\n\\page choosing_memory_type Choosing memory type\n\nPhysical devices in Vulkan support various combinations of memory heaps and\ntypes. Help with choosing correct and optimal memory type for your specific\nresource is one of the key features of this library. You can use it by filling\nappropriate members of VmaAllocationCreateInfo structure, as described below.\nYou can also combine multiple methods.\n\n-# If you just want to find memory type index that meets your requirements, you\n   can use function: vmaFindMemoryTypeIndex(), vmaFindMemoryTypeIndexForBufferInfo(),\n   vmaFindMemoryTypeIndexForImageInfo().\n-# If you want to allocate a region of device memory without association with any\n   specific image or buffer, you can use function vmaAllocateMemory(). Usage of\n   this function is not recommended and usually not needed.\n   vmaAllocateMemoryPages() function is also provided for creating multiple allocations at once,\n   which may be useful for sparse binding.\n-# If you already have a buffer or an image created, you want to allocate memory\n   for it and then you will bind it yourself, you can use function\n   vmaAllocateMemoryForBuffer(), vmaAllocateMemoryForImage().\n   For binding you should use functions: vmaBindBufferMemory(), vmaBindImageMemory()\n   or their extended versions: vmaBindBufferMemory2(), vmaBindImageMemory2().\n-# If you want to create a buffer or an image, allocate memory for it and bind\n   them together, all in one call, you can use function vmaCreateBuffer(),\n   vmaCreateImage(). This is the easiest and recommended way to use this library.\n\nWhen using 3. or 4., the library internally queries Vulkan for memory types\nsupported for that buffer or image (function `vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements()`)\nand uses only one of these types.\n\nIf no memory type can be found that meets all the requirements, these functions\nreturn `VK_ERROR_FEATURE_NOT_PRESENT`.\n\nYou can leave VmaAllocationCreateInfo structure completely filled with zeros.\nIt means no requirements are specified for memory type.\nIt is valid, although not very useful.\n\n\\section choosing_memory_type_usage Usage\n\nThe easiest way to specify memory requirements is to fill member\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo::usage using one of the values of enum #VmaMemoryUsage.\nIt defines high level, common usage types.\nFor more details, see description of this enum.\n\nFor example, if you want to create a uniform buffer that will be filled using\ntransfer only once or infrequently and used for rendering every frame, you can\ndo it using following code:\n\n\\code\nVkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };\nbufferInfo.size = 65536;\nbufferInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;\n\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo allocInfo = {};\nallocInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;\n\nVkBuffer buffer;\nVmaAllocation allocation;\nvmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);\n\\endcode\n\n\\section choosing_memory_type_required_preferred_flags Required and preferred flags\n\nYou can specify more detailed requirements by filling members\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo::requiredFlags and VmaAllocationCreateInfo::preferredFlags\nwith a combination of bits from enum `VkMemoryPropertyFlags`. For example,\nif you want to create a buffer that will be persistently mapped on host (so it\nmust be `HOST_VISIBLE`) and preferably will also be `HOST_COHERENT` and `HOST_CACHED`,\nuse following code:\n\n\\code\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo allocInfo = {};\nallocInfo.requiredFlags = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT;\nallocInfo.preferredFlags = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT;\nallocInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT;\n\nVkBuffer buffer;\nVmaAllocation allocation;\nvmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);\n\\endcode\n\nA memory type is chosen that has all the required flags and as many preferred\nflags set as possible.\n\nIf you use VmaAllocationCreateInfo::usage, it is just internally converted to\na set of required and preferred flags.\n\n\\section choosing_memory_type_explicit_memory_types Explicit memory types\n\nIf you inspected memory types available on the physical device and you have\na preference for memory types that you want to use, you can fill member\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo::memoryTypeBits. It is a bit mask, where each bit set\nmeans that a memory type with that index is allowed to be used for the\nallocation. Special value 0, just like `UINT32_MAX`, means there are no\nrestrictions to memory type index.\n\nPlease note that this member is NOT just a memory type index.\nStill you can use it to choose just one, specific memory type.\nFor example, if you already determined that your buffer should be created in\nmemory type 2, use following code:\n\n\\code\nuint32_t memoryTypeIndex = 2;\n\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo allocInfo = {};\nallocInfo.memoryTypeBits = 1u << memoryTypeIndex;\n\nVkBuffer buffer;\nVmaAllocation allocation;\nvmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);\n\\endcode\n\n\n\\section choosing_memory_type_custom_memory_pools Custom memory pools\n\nIf you allocate from custom memory pool, all the ways of specifying memory\nrequirements described above are not applicable and the aforementioned members\nof VmaAllocationCreateInfo structure are ignored. Memory type is selected\nexplicitly when creating the pool and then used to make all the allocations from\nthat pool. For further details, see \\ref custom_memory_pools.\n\n\\section choosing_memory_type_dedicated_allocations Dedicated allocations\n\nMemory for allocations is reserved out of larger block of `VkDeviceMemory`\nallocated from Vulkan internally. That is the main feature of this whole library.\nYou can still request a separate memory block to be created for an allocation,\njust like you would do in a trivial solution without using any allocator.\nIn that case, a buffer or image is always bound to that memory at offset 0.\nThis is called a \"dedicated allocation\".\nYou can explicitly request it by using flag #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_DEDICATED_MEMORY_BIT.\nThe library can also internally decide to use dedicated allocation in some cases, e.g.:\n\n- When the size of the allocation is large.\n- When [VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation](@ref vk_khr_dedicated_allocation) extension is enabled\n  and it reports that dedicated allocation is required or recommended for the resource.\n- When allocation of next big memory block fails due to not enough device memory,\n  but allocation with the exact requested size succeeds.\n\n\n\\page memory_mapping Memory mapping\n\nTo \"map memory\" in Vulkan means to obtain a CPU pointer to `VkDeviceMemory`,\nto be able to read from it or write to it in CPU code.\nMapping is possible only of memory allocated from a memory type that has\n`VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT` flag.\nFunctions `vkMapMemory()`, `vkUnmapMemory()` are designed for this purpose.\nYou can use them directly with memory allocated by this library,\nbut it is not recommended because of following issue:\nMapping the same `VkDeviceMemory` block multiple times is illegal - only one mapping at a time is allowed.\nThis includes mapping disjoint regions. Mapping is not reference-counted internally by Vulkan.\nBecause of this, Vulkan Memory Allocator provides following facilities:\n\n\\section memory_mapping_mapping_functions Mapping functions\n\nThe library provides following functions for mapping of a specific #VmaAllocation: vmaMapMemory(), vmaUnmapMemory().\nThey are safer and more convenient to use than standard Vulkan functions.\nYou can map an allocation multiple times simultaneously - mapping is reference-counted internally.\nYou can also map different allocations simultaneously regardless of whether they use the same `VkDeviceMemory` block.\nThe way it is implemented is that the library always maps entire memory block, not just region of the allocation.\nFor further details, see description of vmaMapMemory() function.\nExample:\n\n\\code\n// Having these objects initialized:\n\nstruct ConstantBuffer\n{\n    ...\n};\nConstantBuffer constantBufferData;\n\nVmaAllocator allocator;\nVkBuffer constantBuffer;\nVmaAllocation constantBufferAllocation;\n\n// You can map and fill your buffer using following code:\n\nvoid* mappedData;\nvmaMapMemory(allocator, constantBufferAllocation, &mappedData);\nmemcpy(mappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));\nvmaUnmapMemory(allocator, constantBufferAllocation);\n\\endcode\n\nWhen mapping, you may see a warning from Vulkan validation layer similar to this one:\n\n<i>Mapping an image with layout VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL can result in undefined behavior if this memory is used by the device. Only GENERAL or PREINITIALIZED should be used.</i>\n\nIt happens because the library maps entire `VkDeviceMemory` block, where different\ntypes of images and buffers may end up together, especially on GPUs with unified memory like Intel.\nYou can safely ignore it if you are sure you access only memory of the intended\nobject that you wanted to map.\n\n\n\\section memory_mapping_persistently_mapped_memory Persistently mapped memory\n\nKepping your memory persistently mapped is generally OK in Vulkan.\nYou don't need to unmap it before using its data on the GPU.\nThe library provides a special feature designed for that:\nAllocations made with #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT flag set in\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo::flags stay mapped all the time,\nso you can just access CPU pointer to it any time\nwithout a need to call any \"map\" or \"unmap\" function.\nExample:\n\n\\code\nVkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };\nbufCreateInfo.size = sizeof(ConstantBuffer);\nbufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT;\n\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};\nallocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY;\nallocCreateInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT;\n\nVkBuffer buf;\nVmaAllocation alloc;\nVmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;\nvmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buf, &alloc, &allocInfo);\n\n// Buffer is already mapped. You can access its memory.\nmemcpy(allocInfo.pMappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));\n\\endcode\n\nThere are some exceptions though, when you should consider mapping memory only for a short period of time:\n\n- When operating system is Windows 7 or 8.x (Windows 10 is not affected because it uses WDDM2),\n  device is discrete AMD GPU,\n  and memory type is the special 256 MiB pool of `DEVICE_LOCAL + HOST_VISIBLE` memory\n  (selected when you use #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_TO_GPU),\n  then whenever a memory block allocated from this memory type stays mapped\n  for the time of any call to `vkQueueSubmit()` or `vkQueuePresentKHR()`, this\n  block is migrated by WDDM to system RAM, which degrades performance. It doesn't\n  matter if that particular memory block is actually used by the command buffer\n  being submitted.\n- Keeping many large memory blocks mapped may impact performance or stability of some debugging tools.\n\n\\section memory_mapping_cache_control Cache flush and invalidate\n\nMemory in Vulkan doesn't need to be unmapped before using it on GPU,\nbut unless a memory types has `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT` flag set,\nyou need to manually **invalidate** cache before reading of mapped pointer\nand **flush** cache after writing to mapped pointer.\nMap/unmap operations don't do that automatically.\nVulkan provides following functions for this purpose `vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges()`,\n`vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges()`, but this library provides more convenient\nfunctions that refer to given allocation object: vmaFlushAllocation(),\nvmaInvalidateAllocation(),\nor multiple objects at once: vmaFlushAllocations(), vmaInvalidateAllocations().\n\nRegions of memory specified for flush/invalidate must be aligned to\n`VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::nonCoherentAtomSize`. This is automatically ensured by the library.\nIn any memory type that is `HOST_VISIBLE` but not `HOST_COHERENT`, all allocations\nwithin blocks are aligned to this value, so their offsets are always multiply of\n`nonCoherentAtomSize` and two different allocations never share same \"line\" of this size.\n\nPlease note that memory allocated with #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY is guaranteed to be `HOST_COHERENT`.\n\nAlso, Windows drivers from all 3 **PC** GPU vendors (AMD, Intel, NVIDIA)\ncurrently provide `HOST_COHERENT` flag on all memory types that are\n`HOST_VISIBLE`, so on this platform you may not need to bother.\n\n\\section memory_mapping_finding_if_memory_mappable Finding out if memory is mappable\n\nIt may happen that your allocation ends up in memory that is `HOST_VISIBLE` (available for mapping)\ndespite it wasn't explicitly requested.\nFor example, application may work on integrated graphics with unified memory (like Intel) or\nallocation from video memory might have failed, so the library chose system memory as fallback.\n\nYou can detect this case and map such allocation to access its memory on CPU directly,\ninstead of launching a transfer operation.\nIn order to do that: call vmaGetAllocationMemoryProperties()\nand look for `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT` flag.\n\n\\code\nVkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };\nbufCreateInfo.size = sizeof(ConstantBuffer);\nbufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;\n\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};\nallocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;\nallocCreateInfo.preferredFlags = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT;\n\nVkBuffer buf;\nVmaAllocation alloc;\nvmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buf, &alloc, nullptr);\n\nVkMemoryPropertyFlags memFlags;\nvmaGetAllocationMemoryProperties(allocator, alloc, &memFlags);\nif((memFlags & VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT) != 0)\n{\n    // Allocation ended up in mappable memory. You can map it and access it directly.\n    void* mappedData;\n    vmaMapMemory(allocator, alloc, &mappedData);\n    memcpy(mappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));\n    vmaUnmapMemory(allocator, alloc);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Allocation ended up in non-mappable memory.\n    // You need to create CPU-side buffer in VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY and make a transfer.\n}\n\\endcode\n\nYou can even use #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT flag while creating allocations\nthat are not necessarily `HOST_VISIBLE` (e.g. using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY).\nIf the allocation ends up in memory type that is `HOST_VISIBLE`, it will be persistently mapped and you can use it directly.\nIf not, the flag is just ignored.\nExample:\n\n\\code\nVkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };\nbufCreateInfo.size = sizeof(ConstantBuffer);\nbufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;\n\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};\nallocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;\nallocCreateInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT;\n\nVkBuffer buf;\nVmaAllocation alloc;\nVmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;\nvmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buf, &alloc, &allocInfo);\n\nif(allocInfo.pMappedData != nullptr)\n{\n    // Allocation ended up in mappable memory.\n    // It is persistently mapped. You can access it directly.\n    memcpy(allocInfo.pMappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Allocation ended up in non-mappable memory.\n    // You need to create CPU-side buffer in VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY and make a transfer.\n}\n\\endcode\n\n\n\\page staying_within_budget Staying within budget\n\nWhen developing a graphics-intensive game or program, it is important to avoid allocating\nmore GPU memory than it is physically available. When the memory is over-committed,\nvarious bad things can happen, depending on the specific GPU, graphics driver, and\noperating system:\n\n- It may just work without any problems.\n- The application may slow down because some memory blocks are moved to system RAM\n  and the GPU has to access them through PCI Express bus.\n- A new allocation may take very long time to complete, even few seconds, and possibly\n  freeze entire system.\n- The new allocation may fail with `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY`.\n- It may even result in GPU crash (TDR), observed as `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`\n  returned somewhere later.\n\n\\section staying_within_budget_querying_for_budget Querying for budget\n\nTo query for current memory usage and available budget, use function vmaGetBudget().\nReturned structure #VmaBudget contains quantities expressed in bytes, per Vulkan memory heap.\n\nPlease note that this function returns different information and works faster than\nvmaCalculateStats(). vmaGetBudget() can be called every frame or even before every\nallocation, while vmaCalculateStats() is intended to be used rarely,\nonly to obtain statistical information, e.g. for debugging purposes.\n\nIt is recommended to use <b>VK_EXT_memory_budget</b> device extension to obtain information\nabout the budget from Vulkan device. VMA is able to use this extension automatically.\nWhen not enabled, the allocator behaves same way, but then it estimates current usage\nand available budget based on its internal information and Vulkan memory heap sizes,\nwhich may be less precise. In order to use this extension:\n\n1. Make sure extensions VK_EXT_memory_budget and VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2\n   required by it are available and enable them. Please note that the first is a device\n   extension and the second is instance extension!\n2. Use flag #VMA_ALLOCATOR_CREATE_EXT_MEMORY_BUDGET_BIT when creating #VmaAllocator object.\n3. Make sure to call vmaSetCurrentFrameIndex() every frame. Budget is queried from\n   Vulkan inside of it to avoid overhead of querying it with every allocation.\n\n\\section staying_within_budget_controlling_memory_usage Controlling memory usage\n\nThere are many ways in which you can try to stay within the budget.\n\nFirst, when making new allocation requires allocating a new memory block, the library\ntries not to exceed the budget automatically. If a block with default recommended size\n(e.g. 256 MB) would go over budget, a smaller block is allocated, possibly even\ndedicated memory for just this resource.\n\nIf the size of the requested resource plus current memory usage is more than the\nbudget, by default the library still tries to create it, leaving it to the Vulkan\nimplementation whether the allocation succeeds or fails. You can change this behavior\nby using #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_WITHIN_BUDGET_BIT flag. With it, the allocation is\nnot made if it would exceed the budget or if the budget is already exceeded.\nSome other allocations become lost instead to make room for it, if the mechanism of\n[lost allocations](@ref lost_allocations) is used.\nIf that is not possible, the allocation fails with `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY`.\nExample usage pattern may be to pass the #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_WITHIN_BUDGET_BIT flag\nwhen creating resources that are not essential for the application (e.g. the texture\nof a specific object) and not to pass it when creating critically important resources\n(e.g. render targets).\n\nFinally, you can also use #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_NEVER_ALLOCATE_BIT flag to make sure\na new allocation is created only when it fits inside one of the existing memory blocks.\nIf it would require to allocate a new block, if fails instead with `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY`.\nThis also ensures that the function call is very fast because it never goes to Vulkan\nto obtain a new block.\n\nPlease note that creating \\ref custom_memory_pools with VmaPoolCreateInfo::minBlockCount\nset to more than 0 will try to allocate memory blocks without checking whether they\nfit within budget.\n\n\n\\page resource_aliasing Resource aliasing (overlap)\n\nNew explicit graphics APIs (Vulkan and Direct3D 12), thanks to manual memory\nmanagement, give an opportunity to alias (overlap) multiple resources in the\nsame region of memory - a feature not available in the old APIs (Direct3D 11, OpenGL).\nIt can be useful to save video memory, but it must be used with caution.\n\nFor example, if you know the flow of your whole render frame in advance, you\nare going to use some intermediate textures or buffers only during a small range of render passes,\nand you know these ranges don't overlap in time, you can bind these resources to\nthe same place in memory, even if they have completely different parameters (width, height, format etc.).\n\n![Resource aliasing (overlap)](../gfx/Aliasing.png)\n\nSuch scenario is possible using VMA, but you need to create your images manually.\nThen you need to calculate parameters of an allocation to be made using formula:\n\n- allocation size = max(size of each image)\n- allocation alignment = max(alignment of each image)\n- allocation memoryTypeBits = bitwise AND(memoryTypeBits of each image)\n\nFollowing example shows two different images bound to the same place in memory,\nallocated to fit largest of them.\n\n\\code\n// A 512x512 texture to be sampled.\nVkImageCreateInfo img1CreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_CREATE_INFO };\nimg1CreateInfo.imageType = VK_IMAGE_TYPE_2D;\nimg1CreateInfo.extent.width = 512;\nimg1CreateInfo.extent.height = 512;\nimg1CreateInfo.extent.depth = 1;\nimg1CreateInfo.mipLevels = 10;\nimg1CreateInfo.arrayLayers = 1;\nimg1CreateInfo.format = VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_SRGB;\nimg1CreateInfo.tiling = VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL;\nimg1CreateInfo.initialLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED;\nimg1CreateInfo.usage = VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT | VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT;\nimg1CreateInfo.samples = VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;\n\n// A full screen texture to be used as color attachment.\nVkImageCreateInfo img2CreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_CREATE_INFO };\nimg2CreateInfo.imageType = VK_IMAGE_TYPE_2D;\nimg2CreateInfo.extent.width = 1920;\nimg2CreateInfo.extent.height = 1080;\nimg2CreateInfo.extent.depth = 1;\nimg2CreateInfo.mipLevels = 1;\nimg2CreateInfo.arrayLayers = 1;\nimg2CreateInfo.format = VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM;\nimg2CreateInfo.tiling = VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL;\nimg2CreateInfo.initialLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED;\nimg2CreateInfo.usage = VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT | VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT;\nimg2CreateInfo.samples = VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;\n\nVkImage img1;\nres = vkCreateImage(device, &img1CreateInfo, nullptr, &img1);\nVkImage img2;\nres = vkCreateImage(device, &img2CreateInfo, nullptr, &img2);\n\nVkMemoryRequirements img1MemReq;\nvkGetImageMemoryRequirements(device, img1, &img1MemReq);\nVkMemoryRequirements img2MemReq;\nvkGetImageMemoryRequirements(device, img2, &img2MemReq);\n\nVkMemoryRequirements finalMemReq = {};\nfinalMemReq.size = std::max(img1MemReq.size, img2MemReq.size);\nfinalMemReq.alignment = std::max(img1MemReq.alignment, img2MemReq.alignment);\nfinalMemReq.memoryTypeBits = img1MemReq.memoryTypeBits & img2MemReq.memoryTypeBits;\n// Validate if(finalMemReq.memoryTypeBits != 0)\n\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};\nallocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;\n\nVmaAllocation alloc;\nres = vmaAllocateMemory(allocator, &finalMemReq, &allocCreateInfo, &alloc, nullptr);\n\nres = vmaBindImageMemory(allocator, alloc, img1);\nres = vmaBindImageMemory(allocator, alloc, img2);\n\n// You can use img1, img2 here, but not at the same time!\n\nvmaFreeMemory(allocator, alloc);\nvkDestroyImage(allocator, img2, nullptr);\nvkDestroyImage(allocator, img1, nullptr);\n\\endcode\n\nRemember that using resources that alias in memory requires proper synchronization.\nYou need to issue a memory barrier to make sure commands that use `img1` and `img2`\ndon't overlap on GPU timeline.\nYou also need to treat a resource after aliasing as uninitialized - containing garbage data.\nFor example, if you use `img1` and then want to use `img2`, you need to issue\nan image memory barrier for `img2` with `oldLayout` = `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED`.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n\n- Vulkan also allows to interpret contents of memory between aliasing resources consistently in some cases.\nSee chapter 11.8. \"Memory Aliasing\" of Vulkan specification or `VK_IMAGE_CREATE_ALIAS_BIT` flag.\n- You can create more complex layout where different images and buffers are bound\nat different offsets inside one large allocation. For example, one can imagine\na big texture used in some render passes, aliasing with a set of many small buffers\nused between in some further passes. To bind a resource at non-zero offset of an allocation,\nuse vmaBindBufferMemory2() / vmaBindImageMemory2().\n- Before allocating memory for the resources you want to alias, check `memoryTypeBits`\nreturned in memory requirements of each resource to make sure the bits overlap.\nSome GPUs may expose multiple memory types suitable e.g. only for buffers or\nimages with `COLOR_ATTACHMENT` usage, so the sets of memory types supported by your\nresources may be disjoint. Aliasing them is not possible in that case.\n\n\n\\page custom_memory_pools Custom memory pools\n\nA memory pool contains a number of `VkDeviceMemory` blocks.\nThe library automatically creates and manages default pool for each memory type available on the device.\nDefault memory pool automatically grows in size.\nSize of allocated blocks is also variable and managed automatically.\n\nYou can create custom pool and allocate memory out of it.\nIt can be useful if you want to:\n\n- Keep certain kind of allocations separate from others.\n- Enforce particular, fixed size of Vulkan memory blocks.\n- Limit maximum amount of Vulkan memory allocated for that pool.\n- Reserve minimum or fixed amount of Vulkan memory always preallocated for that pool.\n- Use extra parameters for a set of your allocations that are available in #VmaPoolCreateInfo but not in\n  #VmaAllocationCreateInfo - e.g., custom minimum alignment, custom `pNext` chain.\n\nTo use custom memory pools:\n\n-# Fill VmaPoolCreateInfo structure.\n-# Call vmaCreatePool() to obtain #VmaPool handle.\n-# When making an allocation, set VmaAllocationCreateInfo::pool to this handle.\n   You don't need to specify any other parameters of this structure, like `usage`.\n\nExample:\n\n\\code\n// Create a pool that can have at most 2 blocks, 128 MiB each.\nVmaPoolCreateInfo poolCreateInfo = {};\npoolCreateInfo.memoryTypeIndex = ...\npoolCreateInfo.blockSize = 128ull * 1024 * 1024;\npoolCreateInfo.maxBlockCount = 2;\n\nVmaPool pool;\nvmaCreatePool(allocator, &poolCreateInfo, &pool);\n\n// Allocate a buffer out of it.\nVkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };\nbufCreateInfo.size = 1024;\nbufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;\n\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};\nallocCreateInfo.pool = pool;\n\nVkBuffer buf;\nVmaAllocation alloc;\nVmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;\nvmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buf, &alloc, &allocInfo);\n\\endcode\n\nYou have to free all allocations made from this pool before destroying it.\n\n\\code\nvmaDestroyBuffer(allocator, buf, alloc);\nvmaDestroyPool(allocator, pool);\n\\endcode\n\n\\section custom_memory_pools_MemTypeIndex Choosing memory type index\n\nWhen creating a pool, you must explicitly specify memory type index.\nTo find the one suitable for your buffers or images, you can use helper functions\nvmaFindMemoryTypeIndexForBufferInfo(), vmaFindMemoryTypeIndexForImageInfo().\nYou need to provide structures with example parameters of buffers or images\nthat you are going to create in that pool.\n\n\\code\nVkBufferCreateInfo exampleBufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };\nexampleBufCreateInfo.size = 1024; // Whatever.\nexampleBufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT; // Change if needed.\n\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};\nallocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY; // Change if needed.\n\nuint32_t memTypeIndex;\nvmaFindMemoryTypeIndexForBufferInfo(allocator, &exampleBufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &memTypeIndex);\n\nVmaPoolCreateInfo poolCreateInfo = {};\npoolCreateInfo.memoryTypeIndex = memTypeIndex;\n// ...\n\\endcode\n\nWhen creating buffers/images allocated in that pool, provide following parameters:\n\n- `VkBufferCreateInfo`: Prefer to pass same parameters as above.\n  Otherwise you risk creating resources in a memory type that is not suitable for them, which may result in undefined behavior.\n  Using different `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_` flags may work, but you shouldn't create images in a pool intended for buffers\n  or the other way around.\n- VmaAllocationCreateInfo: You don't need to pass same parameters. Fill only `pool` member.\n  Other members are ignored anyway.\n\n\\section linear_algorithm Linear allocation algorithm\n\nEach Vulkan memory block managed by this library has accompanying metadata that\nkeeps track of used and unused regions. By default, the metadata structure and\nalgorithm tries to find best place for new allocations among free regions to\noptimize memory usage. This way you can allocate and free objects in any order.\n\n![Default allocation algorithm](../gfx/Linear_allocator_1_algo_default.png)\n\nSometimes there is a need to use simpler, linear allocation algorithm. You can\ncreate custom pool that uses such algorithm by adding flag\n#VMA_POOL_CREATE_LINEAR_ALGORITHM_BIT to VmaPoolCreateInfo::flags while creating\n#VmaPool object. Then an alternative metadata management is used. It always\ncreates new allocations after last one and doesn't reuse free regions after\nallocations freed in the middle. It results in better allocation performance and\nless memory consumed by metadata.\n\n![Linear allocation algorithm](../gfx/Linear_allocator_2_algo_linear.png)\n\nWith this one flag, you can create a custom pool that can be used in many ways:\nfree-at-once, stack, double stack, and ring buffer. See below for details.\nYou don't need to specify explicitly which of these options you are going to use - it is detected automatically.\n\n\\subsection linear_algorithm_free_at_once Free-at-once\n\nIn a pool that uses linear algorithm, you still need to free all the allocations\nindividually, e.g. by using vmaFreeMemory() or vmaDestroyBuffer(). You can free\nthem in any order. New allocations are always made after last one - free space\nin the middle is not reused. However, when you release all the allocation and\nthe pool becomes empty, allocation starts from the beginning again. This way you\ncan use linear algorithm to speed up creation of allocations that you are going\nto release all at once.\n\n![Free-at-once](../gfx/Linear_allocator_3_free_at_once.png)\n\nThis mode is also available for pools created with VmaPoolCreateInfo::maxBlockCount\nvalue that allows multiple memory blocks.\n\n\\subsection linear_algorithm_stack Stack\n\nWhen you free an allocation that was created last, its space can be reused.\nThanks to this, if you always release allocations in the order opposite to their\ncreation (LIFO - Last In First Out), you can achieve behavior of a stack.\n\n![Stack](../gfx/Linear_allocator_4_stack.png)\n\nThis mode is also available for pools created with VmaPoolCreateInfo::maxBlockCount\nvalue that allows multiple memory blocks.\n\n\\subsection linear_algorithm_double_stack Double stack\n\nThe space reserved by a custom pool with linear algorithm may be used by two\nstacks:\n\n- First, default one, growing up from offset 0.\n- Second, \"upper\" one, growing down from the end towards lower offsets.\n\nTo make allocation from the upper stack, add flag #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_UPPER_ADDRESS_BIT\nto VmaAllocationCreateInfo::flags.\n\n![Double stack](../gfx/Linear_allocator_7_double_stack.png)\n\nDouble stack is available only in pools with one memory block -\nVmaPoolCreateInfo::maxBlockCount must be 1. Otherwise behavior is undefined.\n\nWhen the two stacks' ends meet so there is not enough space between them for a\nnew allocation, such allocation fails with usual\n`VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY` error.\n\n\\subsection linear_algorithm_ring_buffer Ring buffer\n\nWhen you free some allocations from the beginning and there is not enough free space\nfor a new one at the end of a pool, allocator's \"cursor\" wraps around to the\nbeginning and starts allocation there. Thanks to this, if you always release\nallocations in the same order as you created them (FIFO - First In First Out),\nyou can achieve behavior of a ring buffer / queue.\n\n![Ring buffer](../gfx/Linear_allocator_5_ring_buffer.png)\n\nPools with linear algorithm support [lost allocations](@ref lost_allocations) when used as ring buffer.\nIf there is not enough free space for a new allocation, but existing allocations\nfrom the front of the queue can become lost, they become lost and the allocation\nsucceeds.\n\n![Ring buffer with lost allocations](../gfx/Linear_allocator_6_ring_buffer_lost.png)\n\nRing buffer is available only in pools with one memory block -\nVmaPoolCreateInfo::maxBlockCount must be 1. Otherwise behavior is undefined.\n\n\\section buddy_algorithm Buddy allocation algorithm\n\nThere is another allocation algorithm that can be used with custom pools, called\n\"buddy\". Its internal data structure is based on a binary tree of blocks, each having\nsize that is a power of two and a half of its parent's size. When you want to\nallocate memory of certain size, a free node in the tree is located. If it is too\nlarge, it is recursively split into two halves (called \"buddies\"). However, if\nrequested allocation size is not a power of two, the size of the allocation is\naligned up to the nearest power of two and the remaining space is wasted. When\ntwo buddy nodes become free, they are merged back into one larger node.\n\n![Buddy allocator](../gfx/Buddy_allocator.png)\n\nThe advantage of buddy allocation algorithm over default algorithm is faster\nallocation and deallocation, as well as smaller external fragmentation. The\ndisadvantage is more wasted space (internal fragmentation).\nFor more information, please search the Internet for \"Buddy memory allocation\" -\nsources that describe this concept in general.\n\nTo use buddy allocation algorithm with a custom pool, add flag\n#VMA_POOL_CREATE_BUDDY_ALGORITHM_BIT to VmaPoolCreateInfo::flags while creating\n#VmaPool object.\n\nSeveral limitations apply to pools that use buddy algorithm:\n\n- It is recommended to use VmaPoolCreateInfo::blockSize that is a power of two.\n  Otherwise, only largest power of two smaller than the size is used for\n  allocations. The remaining space always stays unused.\n- [Margins](@ref debugging_memory_usage_margins) and\n  [corruption detection](@ref debugging_memory_usage_corruption_detection)\n  don't work in such pools.\n- [Lost allocations](@ref lost_allocations) don't work in such pools. You can\n  use them, but they never become lost. Support may be added in the future.\n- [Defragmentation](@ref defragmentation) doesn't work with allocations made from\n  such pool.\n\n\\page defragmentation Defragmentation\n\nInterleaved allocations and deallocations of many objects of varying size can\ncause fragmentation over time, which can lead to a situation where the library is unable\nto find a continuous range of free memory for a new allocation despite there is\nenough free space, just scattered across many small free ranges between existing\nallocations.\n\nTo mitigate this problem, you can use defragmentation feature:\nstructure #VmaDefragmentationInfo2, function vmaDefragmentationBegin(), vmaDefragmentationEnd().\nGiven set of allocations,\nthis function can move them to compact used memory, ensure more continuous free\nspace and possibly also free some `VkDeviceMemory` blocks.\n\nWhat the defragmentation does is:\n\n- Updates #VmaAllocation objects to point to new `VkDeviceMemory` and offset.\n  After allocation has been moved, its VmaAllocationInfo::deviceMemory and/or\n  VmaAllocationInfo::offset changes. You must query them again using\n  vmaGetAllocationInfo() if you need them.\n- Moves actual data in memory.\n\nWhat it doesn't do, so you need to do it yourself:\n\n- Recreate buffers and images that were bound to allocations that were defragmented and\n  bind them with their new places in memory.\n  You must use `vkDestroyBuffer()`, `vkDestroyImage()`,\n  `vkCreateBuffer()`, `vkCreateImage()`, vmaBindBufferMemory(), vmaBindImageMemory()\n  for that purpose and NOT vmaDestroyBuffer(),\n  vmaDestroyImage(), vmaCreateBuffer(), vmaCreateImage(), because you don't need to\n  destroy or create allocation objects!\n- Recreate views and update descriptors that point to these buffers and images.\n\n\\section defragmentation_cpu Defragmenting CPU memory\n\nFollowing example demonstrates how you can run defragmentation on CPU.\nOnly allocations created in memory types that are `HOST_VISIBLE` can be defragmented.\nOthers are ignored.\n\nThe way it works is:\n\n- It temporarily maps entire memory blocks when necessary.\n- It moves data using `memmove()` function.\n\n\\code\n// Given following variables already initialized:\nVkDevice device;\nVmaAllocator allocator;\nstd::vector<VkBuffer> buffers;\nstd::vector<VmaAllocation> allocations;\n\n\nconst uint32_t allocCount = (uint32_t)allocations.size();\nstd::vector<VkBool32> allocationsChanged(allocCount);\n\nVmaDefragmentationInfo2 defragInfo = {};\ndefragInfo.allocationCount = allocCount;\ndefragInfo.pAllocations = allocations.data();\ndefragInfo.pAllocationsChanged = allocationsChanged.data();\ndefragInfo.maxCpuBytesToMove = VK_WHOLE_SIZE; // No limit.\ndefragInfo.maxCpuAllocationsToMove = UINT32_MAX; // No limit.\n\nVmaDefragmentationContext defragCtx;\nvmaDefragmentationBegin(allocator, &defragInfo, nullptr, &defragCtx);\nvmaDefragmentationEnd(allocator, defragCtx);\n\nfor(uint32_t i = 0; i < allocCount; ++i)\n{\n    if(allocationsChanged[i])\n    {\n        // Destroy buffer that is immutably bound to memory region which is no longer valid.\n        vkDestroyBuffer(device, buffers[i], nullptr);\n\n        // Create new buffer with same parameters.\n        VkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = ...;\n        vkCreateBuffer(device, &bufferInfo, nullptr, &buffers[i]);\n\n        // You can make dummy call to vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements here to silence validation layer warning.\n\n        // Bind new buffer to new memory region. Data contained in it is already moved.\n        VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;\n        vmaGetAllocationInfo(allocator, allocations[i], &allocInfo);\n        vmaBindBufferMemory(allocator, allocations[i], buffers[i]);\n    }\n}\n\\endcode\n\nSetting VmaDefragmentationInfo2::pAllocationsChanged is optional.\nThis output array tells whether particular allocation in VmaDefragmentationInfo2::pAllocations at the same index\nhas been modified during defragmentation.\nYou can pass null, but you then need to query every allocation passed to defragmentation\nfor new parameters using vmaGetAllocationInfo() if you might need to recreate and rebind a buffer or image associated with it.\n\nIf you use [Custom memory pools](@ref choosing_memory_type_custom_memory_pools),\nyou can fill VmaDefragmentationInfo2::poolCount and VmaDefragmentationInfo2::pPools\ninstead of VmaDefragmentationInfo2::allocationCount and VmaDefragmentationInfo2::pAllocations\nto defragment all allocations in given pools.\nYou cannot use VmaDefragmentationInfo2::pAllocationsChanged in that case.\nYou can also combine both methods.\n\n\\section defragmentation_gpu Defragmenting GPU memory\n\nIt is also possible to defragment allocations created in memory types that are not `HOST_VISIBLE`.\nTo do that, you need to pass a command buffer that meets requirements as described in\nVmaDefragmentationInfo2::commandBuffer. The way it works is:\n\n- It creates temporary buffers and binds them to entire memory blocks when necessary.\n- It issues `vkCmdCopyBuffer()` to passed command buffer.\n\nExample:\n\n\\code\n// Given following variables already initialized:\nVkDevice device;\nVmaAllocator allocator;\nVkCommandBuffer commandBuffer;\nstd::vector<VkBuffer> buffers;\nstd::vector<VmaAllocation> allocations;\n\n\nconst uint32_t allocCount = (uint32_t)allocations.size();\nstd::vector<VkBool32> allocationsChanged(allocCount);\n\nVkCommandBufferBeginInfo cmdBufBeginInfo = ...;\nvkBeginCommandBuffer(commandBuffer, &cmdBufBeginInfo);\n\nVmaDefragmentationInfo2 defragInfo = {};\ndefragInfo.allocationCount = allocCount;\ndefragInfo.pAllocations = allocations.data();\ndefragInfo.pAllocationsChanged = allocationsChanged.data();\ndefragInfo.maxGpuBytesToMove = VK_WHOLE_SIZE; // Notice it is \"GPU\" this time.\ndefragInfo.maxGpuAllocationsToMove = UINT32_MAX; // Notice it is \"GPU\" this time.\ndefragInfo.commandBuffer = commandBuffer;\n\nVmaDefragmentationContext defragCtx;\nvmaDefragmentationBegin(allocator, &defragInfo, nullptr, &defragCtx);\n\nvkEndCommandBuffer(commandBuffer);\n\n// Submit commandBuffer.\n// Wait for a fence that ensures commandBuffer execution finished.\n\nvmaDefragmentationEnd(allocator, defragCtx);\n\nfor(uint32_t i = 0; i < allocCount; ++i)\n{\n    if(allocationsChanged[i])\n    {\n        // Destroy buffer that is immutably bound to memory region which is no longer valid.\n        vkDestroyBuffer(device, buffers[i], nullptr);\n\n        // Create new buffer with same parameters.\n        VkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = ...;\n        vkCreateBuffer(device, &bufferInfo, nullptr, &buffers[i]);\n\n        // You can make dummy call to vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements here to silence validation layer warning.\n\n        // Bind new buffer to new memory region. Data contained in it is already moved.\n        VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;\n        vmaGetAllocationInfo(allocator, allocations[i], &allocInfo);\n        vmaBindBufferMemory(allocator, allocations[i], buffers[i]);\n    }\n}\n\\endcode\n\nYou can combine these two methods by specifying non-zero `maxGpu*` as well as `maxCpu*` parameters.\nThe library automatically chooses best method to defragment each memory pool.\n\nYou may try not to block your entire program to wait until defragmentation finishes,\nbut do it in the background, as long as you carefully fullfill requirements described\nin function vmaDefragmentationBegin().\n\n\\section defragmentation_additional_notes Additional notes\n\nIt is only legal to defragment allocations bound to:\n\n- buffers\n- images created with `VK_IMAGE_CREATE_ALIAS_BIT`, `VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR`, and\n  being currently in `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL` or `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED`.\n\nDefragmentation of images created with `VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL` or in any other\nlayout may give undefined results.\n\nIf you defragment allocations bound to images, new images to be bound to new\nmemory region after defragmentation should be created with `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED`\nand then transitioned to their original layout from before defragmentation if\nneeded using an image memory barrier.\n\nWhile using defragmentation, you may experience validation layer warnings, which you just need to ignore.\nSee [Validation layer warnings](@ref general_considerations_validation_layer_warnings).\n\nPlease don't expect memory to be fully compacted after defragmentation.\nAlgorithms inside are based on some heuristics that try to maximize number of Vulkan\nmemory blocks to make totally empty to release them, as well as to maximize continuous\nempty space inside remaining blocks, while minimizing the number and size of allocations that\nneed to be moved. Some fragmentation may still remain - this is normal.\n\n\\section defragmentation_custom_algorithm Writing custom defragmentation algorithm\n\nIf you want to implement your own, custom defragmentation algorithm,\nthere is infrastructure prepared for that,\nbut it is not exposed through the library API - you need to hack its source code.\nHere are steps needed to do this:\n\n-# Main thing you need to do is to define your own class derived from base abstract\n   class `VmaDefragmentationAlgorithm` and implement your version of its pure virtual methods.\n   See definition and comments of this class for details.\n-# Your code needs to interact with device memory block metadata.\n   If you need more access to its data than it is provided by its public interface,\n   declare your new class as a friend class e.g. in class `VmaBlockMetadata_Generic`.\n-# If you want to create a flag that would enable your algorithm or pass some additional\n   flags to configure it, add them to `VmaDefragmentationFlagBits` and use them in\n   VmaDefragmentationInfo2::flags.\n-# Modify function `VmaBlockVectorDefragmentationContext::Begin` to create object\n   of your new class whenever needed.\n\n\n\\page lost_allocations Lost allocations\n\nIf your game oversubscribes video memory, if may work OK in previous-generation\ngraphics APIs (DirectX 9, 10, 11, OpenGL) because resources are automatically\npaged to system RAM. In Vulkan you can't do it because when you run out of\nmemory, an allocation just fails. If you have more data (e.g. textures) that can\nfit into VRAM and you don't need it all at once, you may want to upload them to\nGPU on demand and \"push out\" ones that are not used for a long time to make room\nfor the new ones, effectively using VRAM (or a cartain memory pool) as a form of\ncache. Vulkan Memory Allocator can help you with that by supporting a concept of\n\"lost allocations\".\n\nTo create an allocation that can become lost, include #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_BECOME_LOST_BIT\nflag in VmaAllocationCreateInfo::flags. Before using a buffer or image bound to\nsuch allocation in every new frame, you need to query it if it is not lost.\nTo check it, call vmaTouchAllocation().\nIf the allocation is lost, you should not use it or buffer/image bound to it.\nYou mustn't forget to destroy this allocation and this buffer/image.\nvmaGetAllocationInfo() can also be used for checking status of the allocation.\nAllocation is lost when returned VmaAllocationInfo::deviceMemory == `VK_NULL_HANDLE`.\n\nTo create an allocation that can make some other allocations lost to make room\nfor it, use #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT flag. You will\nusually use both flags #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT and\n#VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_BECOME_LOST_BIT at the same time.\n\nWarning! Current implementation uses quite naive, brute force algorithm,\nwhich can make allocation calls that use #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT\nflag quite slow. A new, more optimal algorithm and data structure to speed this\nup is planned for the future.\n\n<b>Q: When interleaving creation of new allocations with usage of existing ones,\nhow do you make sure that an allocation won't become lost while it is used in the\ncurrent frame?</b>\n\nIt is ensured because vmaTouchAllocation() / vmaGetAllocationInfo() not only returns allocation\nstatus/parameters and checks whether it is not lost, but when it is not, it also\natomically marks it as used in the current frame, which makes it impossible to\nbecome lost in that frame. It uses lockless algorithm, so it works fast and\ndoesn't involve locking any internal mutex.\n\n<b>Q: What if my allocation may still be in use by the GPU when it is rendering a\nprevious frame while I already submit new frame on the CPU?</b>\n\nYou can make sure that allocations \"touched\" by vmaTouchAllocation() / vmaGetAllocationInfo() will not\nbecome lost for a number of additional frames back from the current one by\nspecifying this number as VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::frameInUseCount (for default\nmemory pool) and VmaPoolCreateInfo::frameInUseCount (for custom pool).\n\n<b>Q: How do you inform the library when new frame starts?</b>\n\nYou need to call function vmaSetCurrentFrameIndex().\n\nExample code:\n\n\\code\nstruct MyBuffer\n{\n    VkBuffer m_Buf = nullptr;\n    VmaAllocation m_Alloc = nullptr;\n\n    // Called when the buffer is really needed in the current frame.\n    void EnsureBuffer();\n};\n\nvoid MyBuffer::EnsureBuffer()\n{\n    // Buffer has been created.\n    if(m_Buf != VK_NULL_HANDLE)\n    {\n        // Check if its allocation is not lost + mark it as used in current frame.\n        if(vmaTouchAllocation(allocator, m_Alloc))\n        {\n            // It is all OK - safe to use m_Buf.\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Buffer not yet exists or lost - destroy and recreate it.\n\n    vmaDestroyBuffer(allocator, m_Buf, m_Alloc);\n\n    VkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };\n    bufCreateInfo.size = 1024;\n    bufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;\n\n    VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};\n    allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;\n    allocCreateInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_BECOME_LOST_BIT |\n        VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT;\n\n    vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &m_Buf, &m_Alloc, nullptr);\n}\n\\endcode\n\nWhen using lost allocations, you may see some Vulkan validation layer warnings\nabout overlapping regions of memory bound to different kinds of buffers and\nimages. This is still valid as long as you implement proper handling of lost\nallocations (like in the example above) and don't use them.\n\nYou can create an allocation that is already in lost state from the beginning using function\nvmaCreateLostAllocation(). It may be useful if you need a \"dummy\" allocation that is not null.\n\nYou can call function vmaMakePoolAllocationsLost() to set all eligible allocations\nin a specified custom pool to lost state.\nAllocations that have been \"touched\" in current frame or VmaPoolCreateInfo::frameInUseCount frames back\ncannot become lost.\n\n<b>Q: Can I touch allocation that cannot become lost?</b>\n\nYes, although it has no visible effect.\nCalls to vmaGetAllocationInfo() and vmaTouchAllocation() update last use frame index\nalso for allocations that cannot become lost, but the only way to observe it is to dump\ninternal allocator state using vmaBuildStatsString().\nYou can use this feature for debugging purposes to explicitly mark allocations that you use\nin current frame and then analyze JSON dump to see for how long each allocation stays unused.\n\n\n\\page statistics Statistics\n\nThis library contains functions that return information about its internal state,\nespecially the amount of memory allocated from Vulkan.\nPlease keep in mind that these functions need to traverse all internal data structures\nto gather these information, so they may be quite time-consuming.\nDon't call them too often.\n\n\\section statistics_numeric_statistics Numeric statistics\n\nYou can query for overall statistics of the allocator using function vmaCalculateStats().\nInformation are returned using structure #VmaStats.\nIt contains #VmaStatInfo - number of allocated blocks, number of allocations\n(occupied ranges in these blocks), number of unused (free) ranges in these blocks,\nnumber of bytes used and unused (but still allocated from Vulkan) and other information.\nThey are summed across memory heaps, memory types and total for whole allocator.\n\nYou can query for statistics of a custom pool using function vmaGetPoolStats().\nInformation are returned using structure #VmaPoolStats.\n\nYou can query for information about specific allocation using function vmaGetAllocationInfo().\nIt fill structure #VmaAllocationInfo.\n\n\\section statistics_json_dump JSON dump\n\nYou can dump internal state of the allocator to a string in JSON format using function vmaBuildStatsString().\nThe result is guaranteed to be correct JSON.\nIt uses ANSI encoding.\nAny strings provided by user (see [Allocation names](@ref allocation_names))\nare copied as-is and properly escaped for JSON, so if they use UTF-8, ISO-8859-2 or any other encoding,\nthis JSON string can be treated as using this encoding.\nIt must be freed using function vmaFreeStatsString().\n\nThe format of this JSON string is not part of official documentation of the library,\nbut it will not change in backward-incompatible way without increasing library major version number\nand appropriate mention in changelog.\n\nThe JSON string contains all the data that can be obtained using vmaCalculateStats().\nIt can also contain detailed map of allocated memory blocks and their regions -\nfree and occupied by allocations.\nThis allows e.g. to visualize the memory or assess fragmentation.\n\n\n\\page allocation_annotation Allocation names and user data\n\n\\section allocation_user_data Allocation user data\n\nYou can annotate allocations with your own information, e.g. for debugging purposes.\nTo do that, fill VmaAllocationCreateInfo::pUserData field when creating\nan allocation. It is an opaque `void*` pointer. You can use it e.g. as a pointer,\nsome handle, index, key, ordinal number or any other value that would associate\nthe allocation with your custom metadata.\n\n\\code\nVkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };\n// Fill bufferInfo...\n\nMyBufferMetadata* pMetadata = CreateBufferMetadata();\n\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};\nallocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;\nallocCreateInfo.pUserData = pMetadata;\n\nVkBuffer buffer;\nVmaAllocation allocation;\nvmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);\n\\endcode\n\nThe pointer may be later retrieved as VmaAllocationInfo::pUserData:\n\n\\code\nVmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;\nvmaGetAllocationInfo(allocator, allocation, &allocInfo);\nMyBufferMetadata* pMetadata = (MyBufferMetadata*)allocInfo.pUserData;\n\\endcode\n\nIt can also be changed using function vmaSetAllocationUserData().\n\nValues of (non-zero) allocations' `pUserData` are printed in JSON report created by\nvmaBuildStatsString(), in hexadecimal form.\n\n\\section allocation_names Allocation names\n\nThere is alternative mode available where `pUserData` pointer is used to point to\na null-terminated string, giving a name to the allocation. To use this mode,\nset #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_USER_DATA_COPY_STRING_BIT flag in VmaAllocationCreateInfo::flags.\nThen `pUserData` passed as VmaAllocationCreateInfo::pUserData or argument to\nvmaSetAllocationUserData() must be either null or pointer to a null-terminated string.\nThe library creates internal copy of the string, so the pointer you pass doesn't need\nto be valid for whole lifetime of the allocation. You can free it after the call.\n\n\\code\nVkImageCreateInfo imageInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_CREATE_INFO };\n// Fill imageInfo...\n\nstd::string imageName = \"Texture: \";\nimageName += fileName;\n\nVmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};\nallocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;\nallocCreateInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_USER_DATA_COPY_STRING_BIT;\nallocCreateInfo.pUserData = imageName.c_str();\n\nVkImage image;\nVmaAllocation allocation;\nvmaCreateImage(allocator, &imageInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &image, &allocation, nullptr);\n\\endcode\n\nThe value of `pUserData` pointer of the allocation will be different than the one\nyou passed when setting allocation's name - pointing to a buffer managed\ninternally that holds copy of the string.\n\n\\code\nVmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;\nvmaGetAllocationInfo(allocator, allocation, &allocInfo);\nconst char* imageName = (const char*)allocInfo.pUserData;\nprintf(\"Image name: %s\\n\", imageName);\n\\endcode\n\nThat string is also printed in JSON report created by vmaBuildStatsString().\n\n\\note Passing string name to VMA allocation doesn't automatically set it to the Vulkan buffer or image created with it.\nYou must do it manually using an extension like VK_EXT_debug_utils, which is independent of this library.\n\n\n\\page virtual_allocator Virtual allocator\n\nAs an extra feature, the core allocation algorithm of the library is exposed through a simple and convenient API of \"virtual allocator\".\nIt doesn't allocate any real GPU memory. It just keeps track of used and free regions of a \"virtual block\".\nYou can use it to allocate your own memory or other objects, even completely unrelated to Vulkan.\nA common use case is sub-allocation of pieces of one large GPU buffer.\n\n\\section virtual_allocator_creating_virtual_block Creating virtual block\n\nTo use this functionality, there is no main \"allocator\" object.\nYou don't need to have #VmaAllocator object created.\nAll you need to do is to create a separate #VmaVirtualBlock object for each block of memory you want to be managed by the allocator:\n\n-# Fill in #VmaVirtualBlockCreateInfo structure.\n-# Call vmaCreateVirtualBlock(). Get new #VmaVirtualBlock object.\n\nExample:\n\n\\code\nVmaVirtualBlockCreateInfo blockCreateInfo = {};\nblockCreateInfo.size = 1048576; // 1 MB\n\nVmaVirtualBlock block;\nVkResult res = vmaCreateVirtualBlock(&blockCreateInfo, &block);\n\\endcode\n\n\\section virtual_allocator_making_virtual_allocations Making virtual allocations\n\n#VmaVirtualBlock object contains internal data structure that keeps track of free and occupied regions\nusing the same code as the main Vulkan memory allocator.\nHowever, there is no \"virtual allocation\" object.\nWhen you request a new allocation, a `VkDeviceSize` number is returned.\nIt is an offset inside the block where the allocation has been placed, but it also uniquely identifies the allocation within this block.\n\nIn order to make an allocation:\n\n-# Fill in #VmaVirtualAllocationCreateInfo structure.\n-# Call vmaVirtualAllocate(). Get new `VkDeviceSize offset` that identifies the allocation.\n\nExample:\n\n\\code\nVmaVirtualAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};\nallocCreateInfo.size = 4096; // 4 KB\n\nVkDeviceSize allocOffset;\nres = vmaVirtualAllocate(block, &allocCreateInfo, &allocOffset);\nif(res == VK_SUCCESS)\n{\n    // Use the 4 KB of your memory starting at allocOffset.\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Allocation failed - no space for it could be found. Handle this error!\n}\n\\endcode\n\n\\section virtual_allocator_deallocation Deallocation\n\nWhen no longer needed, an allocation can be freed by calling vmaVirtualFree().\nYou can only pass to this function the exact offset that was previously returned by vmaVirtualAllocate()\nand not any other location within the memory.\n\nWhen whole block is no longer needed, the block object can be released by calling vmaDestroyVirtualBlock().\nAll allocations must be freed before the block is destroyed, which is checked internally by an assert.\nHowever, if you don't want to call vmaVirtualFree() for each allocation, you can use vmaClearVirtualBlock() to free them all at once -\na feature not available in normal Vulkan memory allocator. Example:\n\n\\code\nvmaVirtualFree(block, allocOffset);\nvmaDestroyVirtualBlock(block);\n\\endcode\n\n\\section virtual_allocator_allocation_parameters Allocation parameters\n\nYou can attach a custom pointer to each allocation by using vmaSetVirtualAllocationUserData().\nIts default value is null.\nIt can be used to store any data that needs to be associated with that allocation - e.g. an index, a handle, or a pointer to some\nlarger data structure containing more information. Example:\n\n\\code\nstruct CustomAllocData\n{\n    std::string m_AllocName;\n};\nCustomAllocData* allocData = new CustomAllocData();\nallocData->m_AllocName = \"My allocation 1\";\nvmaSetVirtualAllocationUserData(block, allocOffset, allocData);\n\\endcode\n\nThe pointer can later be fetched, along with allocation size, by passing the allocation offset to function\nvmaGetVirtualAllocationInfo() and inspecting returned structure #VmaVirtualAllocationInfo.\nIf you allocated a new object to be used as the custom pointer, don't forget to delete that object before freeing the allocation!\nExample:\n\n\\code\nVmaVirtualAllocationInfo allocInfo;\nvmaGetVirtualAllocationInfo(block, allocOffset, &allocInfo);\ndelete (CustomAllocData*)allocInfo.pUserData;\n\nvmaVirtualFree(block, allocOffset);\n\\endcode\n\n\\section virtual_allocator_alignment_and_units Alignment and units\n\nIt feels natural to express sizes and offsets in bytes.\nIf an offset of an allocation needs to be aligned to a multiply of some number (e.g. 4 bytes), you can fill optional member\nVmaVirtualAllocationCreateInfo::alignment to request it. Example:\n\n\\code\nVmaVirtualAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};\nallocCreateInfo.size = 4096; // 4 KB\nallocCreateInfo.alignment = 4; // Returned offset must be a multiply of 4 B\n\nVkDeviceSize allocOffset;\nres = vmaVirtualAllocate(block, &allocCreateInfo, &allocOffset);\n\\endcode\n\nAlignments of different allocations made from one block may vary.\nHowever, if all alignments and sizes are always multiply of some size e.g. 4 B or `sizeof(MyDataStruct)`,\nyou can express all sizes, alignments, and offsets in multiples of that size instead of individual bytes.\nIt might be more convenient, but you need to make sure to use this new unit consistently in all the places:\n\n- VmaVirtualBlockCreateInfo::size\n- VmaVirtualAllocationCreateInfo::size and VmaVirtualAllocationCreateInfo::alignment\n- Using offset returned by vmaVirtualAllocate()\n\n\\section virtual_allocator_statistics Statistics\n\nYou can obtain statistics of a virtual block using vmaCalculateVirtualBlockStats().\nThe function fills structure #VmaStatInfo - same as used by the normal Vulkan memory allocator.\nExample:\n\n\\code\nVmaStatInfo statInfo;\nvmaCalculateVirtualBlockStats(block, &statInfo);\nprintf(\"My virtual block has %llu bytes used by %u virtual allocations\\n\",\n    statInfo.usedBytes, statInfo.allocationCount);\n\\endcode\n\nYou can also request a full list of allocations and free regions as a string in JSON format by calling\nvmaBuildVirtualBlockStatsString().\nReturned string must be later freed using vmaFreeVirtualBlockStatsString().\nThe format of this string differs from the one returned by the main Vulkan allocator, but it is similar.\n\n\\section virtual_allocator_additional_considerations Additional considerations\n\nThe \"virtual allocator\" functionality is implemented on a level of individual memory blocks.\nKeeping track of a whole collection of blocks, allocating new ones when out of free space,\ndeleting empty ones, and deciding which one to try first for a new allocation must be implemented by the user.\n\nAlternative allocation algorithms are supported, just like in custom pools of the real GPU memory.\nSee enum #VmaVirtualBlockCreateFlagBits to learn how to specify them (e.g. #VMA_VIRTUAL_BLOCK_CREATE_LINEAR_ALGORITHM_BIT).\nYou can find their description in chapter \\ref custom_memory_pools.\nAllocation strategies are also supported.\nSee enum #VmaVirtualAllocationCreateFlagBits to learn how to specify them (e.g. #VMA_VIRTUAL_ALLOCATION_CREATE_STRATEGY_MIN_TIME_BIT).\n\nFollowing features are supported only by the allocator of the real GPU memory and not by virtual allocations:\nbuffer-image granularity, \\ref lost_allocations, `VMA_DEBUG_MARGIN`, `VMA_MIN_ALIGNMENT`.\n\n\n\\page debugging_memory_usage Debugging incorrect memory usage\n\nIf you suspect a bug with memory usage, like usage of uninitialized memory or\nmemory being overwritten out of bounds of an allocation,\nyou can use debug features of this library to verify this.\n\n\\section debugging_memory_usage_initialization Memory initialization\n\nIf you experience a bug with incorrect and nondeterministic data in your program and you suspect uninitialized memory to be used,\nyou can enable automatic memory initialization to verify this.\nTo do it, define macro `VMA_DEBUG_INITIALIZE_ALLOCATIONS` to 1.\n\n\\code\n#define VMA_DEBUG_INITIALIZE_ALLOCATIONS 1\n#include \"vk_mem_alloc.h\"\n\\endcode\n\nIt makes memory of all new allocations initialized to bit pattern `0xDCDCDCDC`.\nBefore an allocation is destroyed, its memory is filled with bit pattern `0xEFEFEFEF`.\nMemory is automatically mapped and unmapped if necessary.\n\nIf you find these values while debugging your program, good chances are that you incorrectly\nread Vulkan memory that is allocated but not initialized, or already freed, respectively.\n\nMemory initialization works only with memory types that are `HOST_VISIBLE`.\nIt works also with dedicated allocations.\nIt doesn't work with allocations created with #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_BECOME_LOST_BIT flag,\nas they cannot be mapped.\n\n\\section debugging_memory_usage_margins Margins\n\nBy default, allocations are laid out in memory blocks next to each other if possible\n(considering required alignment, `bufferImageGranularity`, and `nonCoherentAtomSize`).\n\n![Allocations without margin](../gfx/Margins_1.png)\n\nDefine macro `VMA_DEBUG_MARGIN` to some non-zero value (e.g. 16) to enforce specified\nnumber of bytes as a margin before and after every allocation.\n\n\\code\n#define VMA_DEBUG_MARGIN 16\n#include \"vk_mem_alloc.h\"\n\\endcode\n\n![Allocations with margin](../gfx/Margins_2.png)\n\nIf your bug goes away after enabling margins, it means it may be caused by memory\nbeing overwritten outside of allocation boundaries. It is not 100% certain though.\nChange in application behavior may also be caused by different order and distribution\nof allocations across memory blocks after margins are applied.\n\nThe margin is applied also before first and after last allocation in a block.\nIt may occur only once between two adjacent allocations.\n\nMargins work with all types of memory.\n\nMargin is applied only to allocations made out of memory blocks and not to dedicated\nallocations, which have their own memory block of specific size.\nIt is thus not applied to allocations made using #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_DEDICATED_MEMORY_BIT flag\nor those automatically decided to put into dedicated allocations, e.g. due to its\nlarge size or recommended by VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation extension.\nMargins are also not active in custom pools created with #VMA_POOL_CREATE_BUDDY_ALGORITHM_BIT flag.\n\nMargins appear in [JSON dump](@ref statistics_json_dump) as part of free space.\n\nNote that enabling margins increases memory usage and fragmentation.\n\n\\section debugging_memory_usage_corruption_detection Corruption detection\n\nYou can additionally define macro `VMA_DEBUG_DETECT_CORRUPTION` to 1 to enable validation\nof contents of the margins.\n\n\\code\n#define VMA_DEBUG_MARGIN 16\n#define VMA_DEBUG_DETECT_CORRUPTION 1\n#include \"vk_mem_alloc.h\"\n\\endcode\n\nWhen this feature is enabled, number of bytes specified as `VMA_DEBUG_MARGIN`\n(it must be multiply of 4) before and after every allocation is filled with a magic number.\nThis idea is also know as \"canary\".\nMemory is automatically mapped and unmapped if necessary.\n\nThis number is validated automatically when the allocation is destroyed.\nIf it is not equal to the expected value, `VMA_ASSERT()` is executed.\nIt clearly means that either CPU or GPU overwritten the memory outside of boundaries of the allocation,\nwhich indicates a serious bug.\n\nYou can also explicitly request checking margins of all allocations in all memory blocks\nthat belong to specified memory types by using function vmaCheckCorruption(),\nor in memory blocks that belong to specified custom pool, by using function\nvmaCheckPoolCorruption().\n\nMargin validation (corruption detection) works only for memory types that are\n`HOST_VISIBLE` and `HOST_COHERENT`.\n\n\n\\page record_and_replay Record and replay\n\n\\section record_and_replay_introduction Introduction\n\nWhile using the library, sequence of calls to its functions together with their\nparameters can be recorded to a file and later replayed using standalone player\napplication. It can be useful to:\n\n- Test correctness - check if same sequence of calls will not cause crash or\n  failures on a target platform.\n- Gather statistics - see number of allocations, peak memory usage, number of\n  calls etc.\n- Benchmark performance - see how much time it takes to replay the whole\n  sequence.\n\n\\section record_and_replay_usage Usage\n\nRecording functionality is disabled by default.\nTo enable it, define following macro before every include of this library:\n\n\\code\n#define VMA_RECORDING_ENABLED 1\n\\endcode\n\n<b>To record sequence of calls to a file:</b> Fill in\nVmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pRecordSettings member while creating #VmaAllocator\nobject. File is opened and written during whole lifetime of the allocator.\n\n<b>To replay file:</b> Use VmaReplay - standalone command-line program.\nPrecompiled binary can be found in \"bin\" directory.\nIts source can be found in \"src/VmaReplay\" directory.\nIts project is generated by Premake.\nCommand line syntax is printed when the program is launched without parameters.\nBasic usage:\n\n    VmaReplay.exe MyRecording.csv\n\n<b>Documentation of file format</b> can be found in file: \"docs/Recording file format.md\".\nIt is a human-readable, text file in CSV format (Comma Separated Values).\n\n\\section record_and_replay_additional_considerations Additional considerations\n\n- Replaying file that was recorded on a different GPU (with different parameters\n  like `bufferImageGranularity`, `nonCoherentAtomSize`, and especially different\n  set of memory heaps and types) may give different performance and memory usage\n  results, as well as issue some warnings and errors.\n- Current implementation of recording in VMA, as well as VmaReplay application, is\n  coded and tested only on Windows. Inclusion of recording code is driven by\n  `VMA_RECORDING_ENABLED` macro. Support for other platforms should be easy to\n  add. Contributions are welcomed.\n\n\n\\page opengl_interop OpenGL Interop\n\nVMA provides some features that help with interoperability with OpenGL.\n\n\\section opengl_interop_exporting_memory Exporting memory\n\nIf you want to attach `VkExportMemoryAllocateInfoKHR` structure to `pNext` chain of memory allocations made by the library:\n\nIt is recommended to create \\ref custom_memory_pools for such allocations.\nDefine and fill in your `VkExportMemoryAllocateInfoKHR` structure and attach it to VmaPoolCreateInfo::pMemoryAllocateNext\nwhile creating the custom pool.\nPlease note that the structure must remain alive and unchanged for the whole lifetime of the #VmaPool,\nnot only while creating it, as no copy of the structure is made,\nbut its original pointer is used for each allocation instead.\n\nIf you want to export all memory allocated by the library from certain memory types,\nalso dedicated allocations or other allocations made from default pools,\nan alternative solution is to fill in VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pTypeExternalMemoryHandleTypes.\nIt should point to an array with `VkExternalMemoryHandleTypeFlagsKHR` to be automatically passed by the library\nthrough `VkExportMemoryAllocateInfoKHR` on each allocation made from a specific memory type.\nThis is currently the only method to use if you need exported dedicated allocations, as they cannot be created out of custom pools.\nThis will change in future versions of the library though.\n\nYou should not mix these two methods in a way that allows to apply both to the same memory type.\nOtherwise, `VkExportMemoryAllocateInfoKHR` structure would be attached twice to the `pNext` chain of `VkMemoryAllocateInfo`.\n\n\n\\section opengl_interop_custom_alignment Custom alignment\n\nBuffers or images exported to a different API like OpenGL may require a different alignment,\nhigher than the one used by the library automatically, queried from functions like `vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements`.\nTo impose such alignment:\n\nIt is recommended to create \\ref custom_memory_pools for such allocations.\nSet VmaPoolCreateInfo::minAllocationAlignment member to the minimum alignment required for each allocation\nto be made out of this pool.\nThe alignment actually used will be the maximum of this member and the alignment returned for the specific buffer or image\nfrom a function like `vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements`, which is called by VMA automatically.\n\nIf you want to create a buffer with a specific minimum alignment out of default pools,\nuse special function vmaCreateBufferWithAlignment(), which takes additional parameter `minAlignment`.\nThis is currently the only method to use if you need exported dedicated allocations, as they cannot be created out of custom pools.\nThis will change in future versions of the library though.\n\nNote the problem of alignment affects only resources placed inside bigger `VkDeviceMemory` blocks and not dedicated\nallocations, as these, by definition, always have alignment = 0 because the resource is bound to the beginning of its dedicated block.\nContrary to Direct3D 12, Vulkan doesn't have a concept of alignment of the entire memory block passed on its allocation.\n\n\n\\page usage_patterns Recommended usage patterns\n\nSee also slides from talk:\n[Sawicki, Adam. Advanced Graphics Techniques Tutorial: Memory management in Vulkan and DX12.

If you create a staging copy\nof a resource to be written by CPU and then used as a source of transfer to\nanother resource placed in the GPU memory, that staging resource should be\ncreated with #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY. Please read the descriptions of these\nenums carefully for details.\n\n<b>Unnecessary use of custom pools</b>\n\n\\ref custom_memory_pools may be useful for special purposes - when you want to\nkeep certain type of resources separate e.g. to reserve minimum amount of memory\nfor them, limit maximum amount of memory they can occupy, or make some of them\npush out the other through the mechanism of \\ref lost_allocations. For most\nresources this is not needed and so it is not recommended to create #VmaPool\nobjects and allocations out of them. Allocating from the default pool is sufficient.\n\n\\section usage_patterns_simple Simple patterns\n\n\\subsection usage_patterns_simple_render_targets Render targets\n\n<b>When:</b>\nAny resources that you frequently write and read on GPU,\ne.g. images used as color attachments (aka \"render targets\"), depth-stencil attachments,\nimages/buffers used as storage image/buffer (aka \"Unordered Access View (UAV)\").\n\n<b>What to do:</b>\nCreate them in video memory that is fastest to access from GPU using\n#VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY.\n\nConsider using [VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation](@ref vk_khr_dedicated_allocation) extension\nand/or manually creating them as dedicated allocations using #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_DEDICATED_MEMORY_BIT,\nespecially if they are large or if you plan to destroy and recreate them e.g. when\ndisplay resolution changes.\nPrefer to create such resources first and all other GPU resources (like textures and vertex buffers) later.\n\n\\subsection usage_patterns_simple_immutable_resources Immutable resources\n\n<b>When:</b>\nAny resources that you fill on CPU only once (aka \"immutable\") or infrequently\nand then read frequently on GPU,\ne.g. textures, vertex and index buffers, constant buffers that don't change often.\n\n<b>What to do:</b>\nCreate them in video memory that is fastest to access from GPU using\n#VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY.\n\nTo initialize content of such resource, create a CPU-side (aka \"staging\") copy of it\nin system memory - #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY, map it, fill it,\nand submit a transfer from it to the GPU resource.\nYou can keep the staging copy if you need it for another upload transfer in the future.\nIf you don't, you can destroy it or reuse this buffer for uploading different resource\nafter the transfer finishes.\n\nPrefer to create just buffers in system memory rather than images, even for uploading textures.\nUse `vkCmdCopyBufferToImage()`.\nDont use images with `VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR`.\n\n\\subsection usage_patterns_dynamic_resources Dynamic resources\n\n<b>When:</b>\nAny resources that change frequently (aka \"dynamic\"), e.g. every frame or every draw call,\nwritten on CPU, read on GPU.\n\n<b>What to do:</b>\nCreate them using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_TO_GPU.\nYou can map it and write to it directly on CPU, as well as read from it on GPU.\n\nThis is a more complex situation. Different solutions are possible,\nand the best one depends on specific GPU type, but you can use this simple approach for the start.\nPrefer to write to such resource sequentially (e.g. using `memcpy`).\nDon't perform random access or any reads from it on CPU, as it may be very slow.\nAlso note that textures written directly from the host through a mapped pointer need to be in LINEAR not OPTIMAL layout.\n\n\\subsection usage_patterns_readback Readback\n\n<b>When:</b>\nResources that contain data written by GPU that you want to read back on CPU,\ne.g. results of some computations.\n\n<b>What to do:</b>\nCreate them using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_TO_CPU.\nYou can write to them directly on GPU, as well as map and read them on CPU.\n\n\\section usage_patterns_advanced Advanced patterns\n\n\\subsection usage_patterns_integrated_graphics Detecting integrated graphics\n\nYou can support integrated graphics (like Intel HD Graphics, AMD APU) better\nby detecting it in Vulkan.\nTo do it, call `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties()`, inspect\n`VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::deviceType` and look for `VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU`.\nWhen you find it, you can assume that memory is unified and all memory types are comparably fast\nto access from GPU, regardless of `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT`.\n\nYou can then sum up sizes of all available memory heaps and treat them as useful for\nyour GPU resources, instead of only `DEVICE_LOCAL` ones.\nYou can also prefer to create your resources in memory types that are `HOST_VISIBLE` to map them\ndirectly instead of submitting explicit transfer (see below).\n\n\\subsection usage_patterns_direct_vs_transfer Direct access versus transfer\n\nFor resources that you frequently write on CPU and read on GPU, many solutions are possible:\n\n-# Create one copy in video memory using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY,\n   second copy in system memory using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY and submit explicit transfer each time.\n-# Create just a single copy using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_TO_GPU, map it and fill it on CPU,\n   read it directly on GPU.\n-# Create just a single copy using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY, map it and fill it on CPU,\n   read it directly on GPU.\n\nWhich solution is the most efficient depends on your resource and especially on the GPU.\nIt is best to measure it and then make the decision.\nSome general recommendations:\n\n- On integrated graphics use (2) or (3) to avoid unnecessary time and memory overhead\n  related to using a second copy and making transfer.\n- For small resources (e.g. constant buffers) use (2).\n  Discrete AMD cards have special 256 MiB pool of video memory that is directly mappable.\n  Even if the resource ends up in system memory, its data may be cached on GPU after first\n  fetch over PCIe bus.\n- For larger resources (e.g. textures), decide between (1) and (2).\n  You may want to differentiate NVIDIA and AMD, e.g. by looking for memory type that is\n  both `DEVICE_LOCAL` and `HOST_VISIBLE`. When you find it, use (2), otherwise use (1).\n\nSimilarly, for resources that you frequently write on GPU and read on CPU, multiple\nsolutions are possible:\n\n-# Create one copy in video memory using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY,\n   second copy in system memory using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_TO_CPU and submit explicit tranfer each time.\n-# Create just single copy using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_TO_CPU, write to it directly on GPU,\n   map it and read it on CPU.\n\nYou should take some measurements to decide which option is faster in case of your specific\nresource.\n\nNote that textures accessed directly from the host through a mapped pointer need to be in LINEAR layout,\nwhich may slow down their usage on the device.\nTextures accessed only by the device and transfer operations can use OPTIMAL layout.\n\nIf you don't want to specialize your code for specific types of GPUs, you can still make\nan simple optimization for cases when your resource ends up in mappable memory to use it\ndirectly in this case instead of creating CPU-side staging copy.\nFor details see [Finding out if memory is mappable](@ref memory_mapping_finding_if_memory_mappable).\n\n\n\\page configuration Configuration\n\nPlease check \"CONFIGURATION SECTION\" in the code to find macros that you can define\nbefore each include of this file or change directly in this file to provide\nyour own implementation of basic facilities like assert, `min()` and `max()` functions,\nmutex, atomic etc.\nThe library uses its own implementation of containers by default, but you can switch to using\nSTL containers instead.\n\nFor example, define `VMA_ASSERT(expr)` before including the library to provide\ncustom implementation of the assertion, compatible with your project.\nBy default it is defined to standard C `assert(expr)` in `_DEBUG` configuration\nand empty otherwise.\n\n\\section config_Vulkan_functions Pointers to Vulkan functions\n\nThere are multiple ways to import pointers to Vulkan functions in the library.\nIn the simplest case you don't need to do anything.\nIf the compilation or linking of your program or the initialization of the #VmaAllocator\ndoesn't work for you, you can try to reconfigure it.\n\nFirst, the allocator tries to fetch pointers to Vulkan functions linked statically,\nlike this:\n\n\\code\nm_VulkanFunctions.vkAllocateMemory = (PFN_vkAllocateMemory)vkAllocateMemory;\n\\endcode\n\nIf you want to disable this feature, set configuration macro: `#define VMA_STATIC_VULKAN_FUNCTIONS 0`.\n\nSecond, you can provide the pointers yourself by setting member VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pVulkanFunctions.\nYou can fetch them e.g. using functions `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` and `vkGetDeviceProcAddr` or\nby using a helper library like [volk](https://github.com/zeux/volk).\n\nThird, VMA tries to fetch remaining pointers that are still null by calling\n`vkGetInstanceProcAddr` and `vkGetDeviceProcAddr` on its own.\nIf you want to disable this feature, set configuration macro: `#define VMA_DYNAMIC_VULKAN_FUNCTIONS 0`.\n\nFinally, all the function pointers required by the library (considering selected\nVulkan version and enabled extensions) are checked with `VMA_ASSERT` if they are not null.\n\n\n\\section custom_memory_allocator Custom host memory allocator\n\nIf you use custom allocator for CPU memory rather than default operator `new`\nand `delete` from C++, you can make this library using your allocator as well\nby filling optional member VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pAllocationCallbacks. These\nfunctions will be passed to Vulkan, as well as used by the library itself to\nmake any CPU-side allocations.\n\n\\section allocation_callbacks Device memory allocation callbacks\n\nThe library makes calls to `vkAllocateMemory()` and `vkFreeMemory()` internally.\nYou can setup callbacks to be informed about these calls, e.g. for the purpose\nof gathering some statistics. To do it, fill optional member\nVmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pDeviceMemoryCallbacks.\n\n\\section heap_memory_limit Device heap memory limit\n\nWhen device memory of certain heap runs out of free space, new allocations may\nfail (returning error code) or they may succeed, silently pushing some existing\nmemory blocks from GPU VRAM to system RAM (which degrades performance). This\nbehavior is implementation-dependent - it depends on GPU vendor and graphics\ndriver.\n\nOn AMD cards it can be controlled while creating Vulkan device object by using\nVK_AMD_memory_overallocation_behavior extension, if available.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to test how your program behaves with limited amount of Vulkan device\nmemory available without switching your graphics card to one that really has\nsmaller VRAM, you can use a feature of this library intended for this purpose.\nTo do it, fill optional member VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pHeapSizeLimit.\n\n\n\n\\page vk_khr_dedicated_allocation VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation\n\nVK_KHR_dedicated_allocation is a Vulkan extension which can be used to improve\nperformance on some GPUs. It augments Vulkan API with possibility to query\ndriver whether it prefers particular buffer or image to have its own, dedicated\nallocation (separate `VkDeviceMemory` block) for better efficiency - to be able\nto do some internal optimizations.\n\nThe extension is supported by this library. It will be used automatically when\nenabled. To enable it:\n\n1 . When creating Vulkan device, check if following 2 device extensions are\nsupported (call `vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties()`).\nIf yes, enable them (fill `VkDeviceCreateInfo::ppEnabledExtensionNames`).\n\n- VK_KHR_get_memory_requirements2\n- VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation\n\nIf you enabled these extensions:\n\n2 . Use #VMA_ALLOCATOR_CREATE_KHR_DEDICATED_ALLOCATION_BIT flag when creating\nyour #VmaAllocator`to inform the library that you enabled required extensions\nand you want the library to use them.\n\n\\code\nallocatorInfo.flags |= VMA_ALLOCATOR_CREATE_KHR_DEDICATED_ALLOCATION_BIT;\n\nvmaCreateAllocator(&allocatorInfo, &allocator);\n\\endcode\n\nThat is all. The extension will be automatically used whenever you create a\nbuffer using vmaCreateBuffer() or image using vmaCreateImage().\n\nWhen using the extension together with Vulkan Validation Layer, you will receive\nwarnings like this:\n\n    vkBindBufferMemory(): Binding memory to buffer 0x33 but vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements() has not been called on that buffer.\n\nIt is OK, you should just ignore it. It happens because you use function\n`vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements2KHR()` instead of standard\n`vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements()`, while the validation layer seems to be\nunaware of it.\n\nTo learn more about this extension, see:\n\n- [VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation in Vulkan specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/chap50.html#VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation)\n- [VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation unofficial manual](http://asawicki.info/articles/VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation.php5)\n\n\n\n\\page vk_amd_device_coherent_memory VK_AMD_device_coherent_memory\n\nVK_AMD_device_coherent_memory is a device extension that enables access to\nadditional memory types with `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD` and\n`VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_UNCACHED_BIT_AMD` flag. It is useful mostly for\nallocation of buffers intended for writing \"breadcrumb markers\" in between passes\nor draw calls, which in turn are useful for debugging GPU crash/hang/TDR cases.\n\nWhen the extension is available but has not been enabled, Vulkan physical device\nstill exposes those memory types, but their usage is forbidden. VMA automatically\ntakes care of that - it returns `VK_ERROR_FEATURE_NOT_PRESENT` when an attempt\nto allocate memory of such type is made.\n\nIf you want to use this extension in connection with VMA, follow these steps:\n\n\\section vk_amd_device_coherent_memory_initialization Initialization\n\n1) Call `vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties` for the physical device.\nCheck if the extension is supported - if returned array of `VkExtensionProperties` contains \"VK_AMD_device_coherent_memory\".\n\n2) Call `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` for the physical device instead of old `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures`.\nAttach additional structure `VkPhysicalDeviceCoherentMemoryFeaturesAMD` to `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2::pNext` to be returned.\nCheck if the device feature is really supported - check if `VkPhysicalDeviceCoherentMemoryFeaturesAMD::deviceCoherentMemory` is true.\n\n3) While creating device with `vkCreateDevice`, enable this extension - add \"VK_AMD_device_coherent_memory\"\nto the list passed as `VkDeviceCreateInfo::ppEnabledExtensionNames`.\n\n4) While creating the device, also don't set `VkDeviceCreateInfo::pEnabledFeatures`.\nFill in `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` structure instead and pass it as `VkDeviceCreateInfo::pNext`.\nEnable this device feature - attach additional structure `VkPhysicalDeviceCoherentMemoryFeaturesAMD` to\n`VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2::pNext` and set its member `deviceCoherentMemory` to `VK_TRUE`.\n\n5) While creating #VmaAllocator with vmaCreateAllocator() inform VMA that you\nhave enabled this extension and feature - add #VMA_ALLOCATOR_CREATE_AMD_DEVICE_COHERENT_MEMORY_BIT\nto VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::flags.\n\n\\section vk_amd_device_coherent_memory_usage Usage\n\nAfter following steps described above, you can create VMA allocations and custom pools\nout of the special `DEVICE_COHERENT` and `DEVICE_UNCACHED` memory types on eligible\ndevices. There are multiple ways to do it, for example:\n\n- You can request or prefer to allocate out of such memory types by adding\n  `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_COHERENT_BIT_AMD` to VmaAllocationCreateInfo::requiredFlags\n  or VmaAllocationCreateInfo::preferredFlags. Those flags can be freely mixed with\n  other ways of \\ref choosing_memory_type, like setting VmaAllocationCreateInfo::usage.\n- If you manually found memory type index to use for this purpose, force allocation\n  from this specific index by setting VmaAllocationCreateInfo::memoryTypeBits `= 1u << index`.\n\n\\section vk_amd_device_coherent_memory_more_information More information\n\nTo learn more about this extension, see [VK_AMD_device_coherent_memory in Vulkan specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_AMD_device_coherent_memory.html)\n\nExample use of this extension can be found in the code of the sample and test suite\naccompanying this library.\n\n\n\\page enabling_buffer_device_address Enabling buffer device address\n\nDevice extension VK_KHR_buffer_device_address\nallow to fetch raw GPU pointer to a buffer and pass it for usage in a shader code.\nIt is promoted to core Vulkan 1.2.\n\nIf you want to use this feature in connection with VMA, follow these steps:\n\n\\section enabling_buffer_device_address_initialization Initialization\n\n1) (For Vulkan version < 1.2) Call `vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties` for the physical device.\nCheck if the extension is supported - if returned array of `VkExtensionProperties` contains\n\"VK_KHR_buffer_device_address\".\n\n2) Call `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` for the physical device instead of old `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures`.\nAttach additional structure `VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeatures*` to `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2::pNext` to be returned.\nCheck if the device feature is really supported - check if `VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeatures::bufferDeviceAddress` is true.\n\n3) (For Vulkan version < 1.2) While creating device with `vkCreateDevice`, enable this extension - add\n\"VK_KHR_buffer_device_address\" to the list passed as `VkDeviceCreateInfo::ppEnabledExtensionNames`.\n\n4) While creating the device, also don't set `VkDeviceCreateInfo::pEnabledFeatures`.\nFill in `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` structure instead and pass it as `VkDeviceCreateInfo::pNext`.\nEnable this device feature - attach additional structure `VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeatures*` to\n`VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2::pNext` and set its member `bufferDeviceAddress` to `VK_TRUE`.\n\n5) While creating #VmaAllocator with vmaCreateAllocator() inform VMA that you\nhave enabled this feature - add #VMA_ALLOCATOR_CREATE_BUFFER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BIT\nto VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::flags.\n\n\\section enabling_buffer_device_address_usage Usage\n\nAfter following steps described above, you can create buffers with `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BIT*` using VMA.\nThe library automatically adds `VK_MEMORY_ALLOCATE_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BIT*` to\nallocated memory blocks wherever it might be needed.\n\nPlease note that the library supports only `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BIT*`.\nThe second part of this functionality related to \"capture and replay\" is not supported,\nas it is intended for usage in debugging tools like RenderDoc, not in everyday Vulkan usage.\n\n\\section enabling_buffer_device_address_more_information More information\n\nTo learn more about this extension, see [VK_KHR_buffer_device_address in Vulkan specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/chap46.html#VK_KHR_buffer_device_address)\n\nExample use of this extension can be found in the code of the sample and test suite\naccompanying this library.\n\n\\page general_considerations General considerations\n\n\\section general_considerations_thread_safety Thread safety\n\n- The library has no global state, so separate #VmaAllocator objects can be used\n  independently.\n  There should be no need to create multiple such objects though - one per `VkDevice` is enough.\n- By default, all calls to functions that take #VmaAllocator as first parameter\n  are safe to call from multiple threads simultaneously because they are\n  synchronized internally when needed.\n- When the allocator is created with #VMA_ALLOCATOR_CREATE_EXTERNALLY_SYNCHRONIZED_BIT\n  flag, calls to functions that take such #VmaAllocator object must be\n  synchronized externally.\n- Access to a #VmaAllocation object must be externally synchronized. For example,\n  you must not call vmaGetAllocationInfo() and vmaMapMemory() from different\n  threads at the same time if you pass the same #VmaAllocation object to these\n  functions.\n\n\\section general_considerations_validation_layer_warnings Validation layer warnings\n\nWhen using this library, you can meet following types of warnings issued by\nVulkan validation layer. They don't necessarily indicate a bug, so you may need\nto just ignore them.\n\n- *vkBindBufferMemory(): Binding memory to buffer 0xeb8e4 but vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements() has not been called on that buffer.*\n  - It happens when VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation extension is enabled.\n    `vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements2KHR` function is used instead, while validation layer seems to be unaware of it.\n- *Mapping an image with layout VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL can result in undefined behavior if this memory is used by the device. Only GENERAL or PREINITIALIZED should be used.*\n  - It happens when you map a buffer or image, because the library maps entire\n    `VkDeviceMemory` block, where different types of images and buffers may end\n    up together, especially on GPUs with unified memory like Intel.\n- *Non-linear image 0xebc91 is aliased with linear buffer 0xeb8e4 which may indicate a bug.*\n  - It happens when you use lost allocations, and a new image or buffer is\n    created in place of an existing object that became lost.\n  - It may happen also when you use [defragmentation](@ref defragmentation).\n\n\\section general_considerations_allocation_algorithm Allocation algorithm\n\nThe library uses following algorithm for allocation, in order:\n\n-# Try to find free range of memory in existing blocks.\n-# If failed, try to create a new block of `VkDeviceMemory`, with preferred block size.\n-# If failed, try to create such block with size/2, size/4, size/8.\n-# If failed and #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT flag was\n   specified, try to find space in existing blocks, possilby making some other\n   allocations lost.\n-# If failed, try to allocate separate `VkDeviceMemory` for this allocation,\n   just like when you use #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_DEDICATED_MEMORY_BIT.\n-# If failed, choose other memory type that meets the requirements specified in\n   VmaAllocationCreateInfo and go to point 1.\n-# If failed, return `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY`.\n\n\\section general_considerations_features_not_supported Features not supported\n\nFeatures deliberately excluded from the scope of this library:\n\n- **Data transfer.** Uploading (streaming) and downloading data of buffers and images\n  between CPU and GPU memory and related synchronization is responsibility of the user.\n  Defining some \"texture\" object that would automatically stream its data from a\n  staging copy in CPU memory to GPU memory would rather be a feature of another,\n  higher-level library implemented on top of VMA.\n- **Recreation of buffers and images.** Although the library has functions for\n  buffer and image creation (vmaCreateBuffer(), vmaCreateImage()), you need to\n  recreate these objects yourself after defragmentation. That is because the big\n  structures `VkBufferCreateInfo`, `VkImageCreateInfo` are not stored in\n  #VmaAllocation object.\n- **Handling CPU memory allocation failures.** When dynamically creating small C++\n  objects in CPU memory (not Vulkan memory), allocation failures are not checked\n  and handled gracefully, because that would complicate code significantly and\n  is usually not needed in desktop PC applications anyway.\n  Success of an allocation is just checked with an assert.\n- **Code free of any compiler warnings.** Maintaining the library to compile and\n  work correctly on so many different platforms is hard enough. Being free of\n  any warnings, on any version of any compiler, is simply not feasible.\n  There are many preprocessor macros that make some variables unused, function parameters unreferenced,\n  or conditional expressions constant in some configurations.\n  The code of this library should not be bigger or more complicated just to silence these warnings.\n  It is recommended to disable such warnings instead.\n- This is a C++ library with C interface. **Bindings or ports to any other programming languages** are welcome as external projects but\n  are not going to be included into this repository.\n*/",
