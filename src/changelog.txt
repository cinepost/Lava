Added:   	Area lights spherical projected solid angle sampling (Urena)

Fixed: 		Deferred shading path tracing optimized, number of shadow rays
			 		reduced. Better path prediction. Ray termination.

Fixed: 		Non normalized area lights intencities

Notes:    Spherical projected solid angle sampling for area lights 
					supports only sphere aread light type at the moment. More
					types (rectangular, disk, tube) to be supported soon.

					As a general rule of thumb spherical projected solid angle
					sampling provides better diffuse illumination of area lights
					at a very small performance cost.

Added: 		Basic refraction support added.

Added: 		Environment light (no hdr texture support yet).

Fixed: 		Directional light (Houdini light type "Sun") direct and 
			 		indirect shading intensities fixed.
