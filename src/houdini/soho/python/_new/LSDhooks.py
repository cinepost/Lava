'''
    This file will import methods from a LSDuserhooks.py file.

    The LSDuserhooks.py file can contain various functions which are called
    during LSD generation.  Look through the LSD*.py files for LSDhooks.call().

    To prevent import recursion, the LSDuserhooks file should be careful how it 
    performs importing of other modules.  For example, if you write some code
    which needs to import part of SOHO (i.e. LSDsettings.py) which imports
    LSDhooks, you can get bad recursion.  You might try something like:

        _MODULES = [ 'outputHooks',
                     'cameraHooks',
                     'instanceHooks' ]
        for hook in _MODULES:
            exec('_%s = None' % hook)

        _magicImport = """
        global _%s
        import %s
        _%s = %s"""

        def _importHookModules():
            for hook in _MODULES:
                exec(_magicImport % ( hook, hook, hook, hook ))

        def pre_lockObjects(parmlist, objparms, now, camera):
            _importHookModules()

    The LSDuserhooks.py file should be installed in
            $HOUDINI_PATH/soho/LSDuserhooks.py
